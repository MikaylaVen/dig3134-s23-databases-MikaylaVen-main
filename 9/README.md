# Module 9: Databases

In this module, there are two primary coding assignments:

**Exercise 9** will have you implementing simple functions that accomplish either inserting data into a database or returning data based on requirements.

**Lab 9** requires you to build out the features previously explored in the social media application by adding database functionality to the express routes.
